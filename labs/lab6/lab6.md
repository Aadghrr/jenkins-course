# Exercise 6

- Work from the app `maven-code-coverage`.

* Add a Job that gets triggered on any branch
* It will run the tests
* It will save the test results and code coverage 

- Install the Cobertura and Junit plugins

* Ensure the CI job reports the current test results and test coverage
* Test what happens if you:

** Break a test
** Reduce Code Coverage

We will learn how to conditionally run integration tests and more on main branch tomorrow!

# Exercise 3

- Add 2 nodes to Jenkins
- Investigate if now the jobs we have run on those nodes, do they run on the controller? To do those check the buildTimeTrend of any job. How long does the jo in a new agent take?
- Setup the controller such that it doesn't run jobs

Why would that be desirable?

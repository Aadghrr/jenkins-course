# Exercise 14

- Create a pipeline that generates a pipeline for the following options:

* Platform being Linux or Windows
* Architecture being 32 or 64 bit
* Exclude 32 bit windows

This pipeline must have a sample `echo` step in a `Build` stage and then `Test` stage. This would mimic testing multiple components for each combination of platforms or languages.

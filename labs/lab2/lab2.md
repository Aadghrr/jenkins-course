# Exercise 2

- Create a second Freestyle Job
- Investigate how to make the job clone the latest commit of the master branch of the repo: https://github.com/axel-sirota/jenkins-course
- In the Build section, compile the code. There are 2 ways of doing this, using the shell of the maven menu. Check both!

What would happen if we specified the branch as any?

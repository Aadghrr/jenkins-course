# Exercise 9

- Take the job from last exercise and make it parametrized with a single parameter of type Choice to package the App
- Package the app and archive the JAR when the parameter is True/Yes/Ok

Bonus: Parametrize not from the UI but within the Declarative Pipeline Syntax

What happens the first time the job runs? Does it "take" the parameter? Why do you think that happens?
